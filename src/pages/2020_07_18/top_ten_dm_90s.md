##10. Dismember##
Let's start this list out with some swedish death metal. Dismember was formed in 1988 and since has been considered as one of Sweden's \"Big Four\" alongside Grave, Entombed and Unleashed. In 1991 Dismember unveiled their majestic debut album titled Like An Ever Flowing Stream which is regarded as a milestone in Swedish metal history. Dismember, like some other Swedish death metal giants, is famous for its inhumanely buzz-sounding guitar tone, which, in contrast to American death metal puts more emphasis on sheer heaviness rather than the rhythm.

##9. Grave##
As stated above, Grave is one of the greatest Swedish death metal bands alongside our pick for #10. While listening to Grave, you will feel like you're in grave danger, indeed. You'd think the idea behind this band is pretty simple if we told you they started out in 1986 as Corpse, not more, not less. Straightforward, face-melting, unholy death metal is the genre. Grave's 1991 debut effort is the definition of staying true to the monolithic structure of death metal monstrosity. This band's earlier efforts sport a very primal-sounding production, which, quite frankly, sounds absolutely atrocious - in the best way possible, of course.

##8. Entombed##
Don't tell us, you didn't see this one coming. If you've ever been interested in death metal, you've probably already heard about the \"Left Hand Path\" album and its absolutely mesmerizing title track. Formed in 1987, initially as Nihilist, Entombed went on to become one of the greatest death metal bands of all time due to their ability to combine groove, melody and fast-paced blastbeats so well. One main thing that Entombed made itself unique with in the early 90s was the so-called \"buzz saw\" guitar tone that would occasionally jump out of the blue and peel the skin off your face. Unlike most death metal bands, Entombed successfully branched out of its genre and established what's now referred to as \"Death 'n' Roll\", an ungodly mixture of, you guessed it, rock 'n' roll and death metal.
